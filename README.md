# Data Wrangling, Analysis and AB Testing with SQL
This course allows to apply SQL skills to complex and authentic data science inquiry case studies. 
- Learned how to convert timestamps of all types to common formats and perform date/time calculations.
- Selected and performed the optimal JOIN for a data science inquiry and cleaned data within an analysis dataset by deduping, running quality checks, backfilling, and handling nulls. 
- Learned how to segment and analyze data per segment using windowing functions and used case statements to execute conditional logic to address a data science inquiry. 
- Described how to convert a query into a scheduled job and how to insert data into a date partition. 
- Given a predictive analysis need, engineered a feature from raw data. 

The real-world application of these skills will provide the framework for performing the analysis of an AB test.
